    "7. Do NOT use BigQuery-specific functions or types such as ARRAY(), STRUCT(), UNNEST(), or ARRAY_AGG() in the SQL.\n"
    "8. For negative/anti-join intents (e.g., 'do not have', 'without', 'students who do not have X'):\n"

    "   d. The correlated subquery must join the junction table to the lookup table inside NOT EXISTS.\n"
    "   e. NEVER add DISTINCT to anti-join queries — it silently drops duplicate rows.\n"
    "   f. Template: SELECT cols FROM subject AS s WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM junction AS j JOIN lookup AS l ON j.fk = l.pk WHERE j.subject_fk = s.pk AND l.filter_col = 'value')\n"
    "9. For 'both A and B' style constraints, prefer GROUP BY ... HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT ...) = N or an equivalent self-join; avoid ad-hoc client-side filtering.\n"
