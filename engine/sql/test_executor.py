"""Test-only executor helper that allows guardrail bypass.

This module provides ``execute_query_for_test`` which resolves safety with
``bypass_guardrail=True`` and then delegates to the shared
``_run_approved_query`` helper in ``executor.py`` — the same execution path
used by the production ``execute_query``.  This file is intentionally
separated from the public executor so that production code paths can never
accidentally pass ``bypass_guardrail=True``.
